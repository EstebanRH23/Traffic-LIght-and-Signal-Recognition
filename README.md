# Traffic-LIght-and-Signal-Recognition
Repository with code, datasets and documentation of the terminal project named "Traffic Light and Traffic Signal Recognition applied to autonomous navigation of mobile robot"

# Summary
There are three main parts of the code:

- SVM_final.py : Code with the training parameters and datasets of a Support Vector Machine with linear kernel.
- Funciones_apoyo.py : Miscellaneous functions used in the execution of the algorithm. (Sliding window algorithm, heat map, HOG parameters, etc.)
